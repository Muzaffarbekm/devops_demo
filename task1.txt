Following things will be done:

2.0 After checking the internet, I will search troubleshoots 

2.1 Check if host IP address is correctly typed.

2.2 (Firewall rules) I would also check the incoming rules allowed by the security group 
(there was a moment when the firewall started up "ufw" and all ports were blocked, 
therefore I couldnâ€™t access my server. Then I called the customer support center)
In Azure, Aws, and Google Cloud, this is easier process because you can enable and disable ports 
from the developer console network security policy.

2.3 Check if service is running properly (Is it running or not)

2.4 If server is connected to Cloudflare , I will add to CNAME record 
to connect via domain name (www.example.com) or I will connect via the server's IP address
